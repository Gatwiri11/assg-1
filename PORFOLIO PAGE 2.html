        Dreams, passion, what you love and everything else in between.We all have dreams, dreams of what we want to be, what we want to do and how we want
    to feel when we do it. When you hear of dreams the second thing that should come to your mind is passion, the love of it all, because I believe
    dreams come hand in hand with passion and all in all why would you have a dream of something you do not love.

         I had this dream of being a fashion stylist from when I was young and right now I can say that I am living my childhood dream.
         Fashion to many is just how one dresses but to me, it is an art, a form of expression and my happy place. It is a career that I really want and I'm
         investing on. I am not yet at the peak of it ,but I hope that one day I will be a brand.
