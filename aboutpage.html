       <p> Dreams, passion, what you love and everything else in between.We all have dreams, dreams of what we want to be, what we want to do and how we want
    to feel when we do it. When you hear of dreams the second thing that should come to your mind is passion, the love of it all, because I believe
    dreams come hand in hand with passion and all in all why would you have a dream of something you do not love.</p>

        <p>IG was founded by a young lady called Emmaculate Gatwiri.This brand started as a dream of being a fashion stylist from when she was young and right now she can say that she is living her childhood dream.
         Fashion to many is just how one dresses but to her, it was an art, a form of expression and a happy place. Because of this she started her own brand
         called I'M GATWIRI.</p>
